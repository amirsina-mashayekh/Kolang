# Kolang
Kolang is a general-purpose programming language. I'm working on this project as a hobby.

## What does *Kolang* mean?
Kolang (Persian: کُلَنْگ; /kolang/) is a Persian word that means *Pickaxe*.

I chose this name for fun. 😁

The name also contains the part *lang* which can be an abbreviation for *language*; so you can also think of Kolang as a **Kool language**! 😎
